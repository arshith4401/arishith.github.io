            <p><strong>Prodapt Solutions, Hyderabad, India</strong><br>
            Software Developer<br>
            Mar 2020 - July 2022</p>

            <p>
                During my tenure at Prodapt Solutions, I worked as a Software Developer, where I was instrumental in spearheading the development of a dynamic sports community platform using JavaScript, AngularJS, and Python. This project significantly fostered user engagement by providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. My responsibilities included designing and innovating the user interface for optimal performance and seamless navigation, leveraging modern frontend frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also integrated advanced features such as customizable user profiles, real-time match updates, and interactive forums to enhance user interaction and satisfaction. Additionally, I orchestrated the deployment of the application on cloud infrastructure using Docker containers and Kubernetes, ensuring scalability and reliability. My role involved maintaining and updating the company's WordPress-based website, where I implemented SEO best practices to enhance visibility and ensured a consistent user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, I was responsible for implementing backend functionalities and managing databases using Python. This included efficient data processing and management, which contributed to the overall robustness and efficiency of the applications I developed. My experience at Prodapt Solutions allowed me to refine my skills in both frontend and backend development, cloud deployment, and user interface design.
